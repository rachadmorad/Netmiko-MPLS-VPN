Regards to all, 

Part of a """ Network automation with python """



In this lab, I used Python3 with the Netmiko library to automate the configuration and BackUp of MPLS VPN L3 Network and IPsec VPN between the two remote sites.



Before I begin, letâ€™s mention the tools I used in this lab:

- GNS3

- Visual studio code.

- Python 3.7.4

- Netmiko library

- 8 Cisco IOS routers.
